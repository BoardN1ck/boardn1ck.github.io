            <p>Nick Records:</p>
            <p>Nick Records is an independent record label founded in the heart of Los Angeles in 2017. With a mission to push boundaries and redefine the music industry, Nick Records is quickly becoming known for discovering and nurturing raw, untapped talent from all over the world. The label is committed to creating a space for artists to explore their creative visions and break away from the norms of mainstream music.</p>
            <p>About Us: </p>
            <p> At Nick Records, we focus on building artists, not just hits. Our label prides itself on its artist-first philosophy, offering an environment where musicians, producers, and songwriters are empowered to take risks and create their best work. Based in LA's vibrant entertainment district, we are at the center of global music culture, drawing influence from a blend of genres ranging from pop, hip-hop, R&B, alternative rock, and electronic.
Founded by music mogul Nick Eakins-Han, the label has seen explosive growth in just a few years, having signed over 25 artists in the past two years alone. Nick, a former music producer with years of experience in the industry, envisioned a label that is as much about innovation as it is about making meaningful connections. His background in both the business and creative sides of music allows him to connect with artists on a personal level, helping them find their unique sound while providing the resources they need to thrive in the fast-paced music world.</p>
